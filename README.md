# D33-SQL-PROJECT
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
IN THIS PROJECT, WE CREATED A LIBRARY MANAGEMNT SYSTEM USING SQL, DESIGNING TABLES FOR BRANCHES, EMPLOYEES, BOOKS, CUSTOMERS, ISSUED DATE, AND RETURN DATE.
THE QUERIES WERE CREATED BASED ON THE NEED OF PARTICULAR DATA FOR EXAMPLE, EMPLOYEES NAMES REGARDING THEIR ISSUED BOOKS, BRANCH NO AND ADDRESSS, CUSTOMER DETAILS, BOOK ID AND PRICE, ISSUED DATE AND RETURN DATE ETC
ALL THESE QUERIES WERE TESTED FOR ACCURACY AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT.
FEW CHANGES WERE MADE TO REQUIRED OUTPUT REGARDING THE INPUT GIVEN.
THIS PROJECT SHOWCASTS THE DATABASE DESIGN ANS SQL SKILLS FOR EFFICIENT LIBRARY MANAGEMENT.
